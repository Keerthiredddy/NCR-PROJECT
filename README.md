# NCR-PROJECT

Observations found in the project are

--> In the instructions file mentioned as "Chess pieces can be placed on the board at a given (x,y) coordinate pair with (0, 0) being in the lower left-hand corner of the board, and (7, 7) being in the top right hand corner of the board".
--> In the project MAX_BOARD_HEIGHT and MAX_BOARD_HEIGHT  given as 7. then cordinatates will be (0,0) to (6,6). So I used whatever there in the application, to pass all the test cases.
--> testIsLegalBoardPosition_False_X_equals_11_Y_equals_5  method in ChessboardTest.java having assertTrue statement. As the coordinate of x is not valid, assertion will be failed. I have changed the assertion statement to pass the test case.

Usage:

This projects helps you to play basic chess games with pawn add and move actions.
